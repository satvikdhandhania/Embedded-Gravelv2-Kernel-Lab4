irq_handler:

	stmfd sp!, {r0-r12, lr} @Store User mode registers on stack

	@We do not need to disable further interrupts as they are automatically
    @disabled by the processor while calling. To enable nesting we need to 
    @enable it manually 
    
    bl C_IRQ_handler        @ go to handler
	
    ldmfd sp!, {r0-r12, lr} @ unstack user's registers and lr_svc 
    subs pc, lr, #4             @ return from handler
